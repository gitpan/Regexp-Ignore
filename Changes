Revision history for Perl extension Regexp::Ignore.

0.02  Tue Sep 24 14:11:39 CEST 2002
        - Fixed the copyright notice. 
        - Changed IgnoreTextCharacteristicsHTML::get_tokens - was
	  checking if there was text before certain token by checking 
	  if ($`). Yet, if the text before is '0', this condition will
	  return false! Fixed it to (length($`)).
        - Besides, the class is old enough to add the comment that it
          probably actually works :-)
